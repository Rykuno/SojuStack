# SojuStack Agent Guidance

Canonical project guidance now lives in:

- `.agents/skills/sojustack-best-practices/SKILL.md`

Use that skill as the source of truth for:

- frontend conventions (TanStack Start/Query/Form + UI)
- backend conventions (NestJS + Drizzle + Better Auth)
- transaction/auth/type-safety guardrails
- implementation workflow and do/don't rules
